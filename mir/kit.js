/* kit.js — the control kit and the device chassis, in the house rack grammar.
 *
 * Primitive types are preserved (§23): boolean → switch, scalar → knob or fader,
 * enumeration → segmented select, event → trigger.  Every control is a real 44 px seat,
 * takes pointer events (mouse, pen and touch alike, `touch-action: none`), and the rack
 * wheel never changes a hovered control (§24).  Knobs reset on double-tap.
 *
 * ── WAVE 62 · EVERY CONTROL IS OPERABLE FROM A KEYBOARD, AND THE LAW WAS ALREADY HERE ───────────
 * `knob()`'s pointer drag moves normalized TRAVEL (`p`) and then denormalizes.  So the key law is
 * not a new one: AN ARROW MOVES A KNOB'S TRAVEL BY A FIXED FRACTION, NEVER ITS VALUE BY A FIXED
 * AMOUNT — one rule that covers a linear and a logarithmic dial with no new mathematics, because on
 * a log knob a fixed fraction of travel is a constant RATIO: 1/100 of RATE's travel is ×1.1085907 at
 * 0.1 and ×1.1085907 at 3000, where a fixed additive step would be a 40 000-press crawl at the bottom
 * and invisible at the top.  1/100 is `<input type=range>`'s own unset-step resolution, which is
 * the muscle memory AT users arrive with; Shift is ×0.25, INHERITED from the pointer's fine drag
 * (220/900) and from the action dispatcher's own `e.shiftKey ? 0.25 : 1`, never re-invented.
 *
 * A CONTROL ANNOUNCES ITSELF THROUGH ITS OWN `fmt`, never as a bare number.  That is correctness
 * here, not taste: DRAG γ formats 0 as 'off', FRICTION formats 0 as '∞ · forever', ELEMENT Z formats
 * 10 as 'Z = 10  Ne'.  `aria-valuetext` carries the unit and the domain word; `aria-valuenow` keeps
 * the tree numerically honest underneath it.
 *
 * AND THE HAZARD, which is the whole reason `paint()` takes an argument: `paint()` runs from the
 * frame loop — for the scrub, for every `[data-live]` dial and for every modulated target — and a
 * screen reader announces a FOCUSED slider's value change.  Writing `aria-valuetext` at 60 Hz on a
 * focused control is a live region built BY ACCIDENT, a hundred readouts speaking ten times a
 * second.  So the value is written when the USER moved it, or when nobody is sitting on it, and
 * never in the one case that would speak.  One boolean; B127 measures that it worked.
 *
 * ── WAVE 68 · SILENCE IS HONEST; A STALE NUMBER IS NOT ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The guard above holds — a live LFO on the dial under the user's own finger makes ZERO aria
 * mutations across three seconds — but for four waves what it left standing in the tree was the
 * string from the moment focus ARRIVED, measured 9.3× off the instrument (ear 1.00 · eye 9.33 ·
 * model 10.27), and even the user's own arrow announced 10.80 while the dial was at 12.00.  A
 * screen-reader user reads `aria-valuetext` ON DEMAND, not only when it changes, so "nothing is
 * spoken" and "what is there is true" are two separate promises and only the first was kept.
 *   THE LAW: **a control the app is driving under a focused user announces THE BASE — the number
 *   the user's own hand owns — and says the word.**  It is not a claim about the current value and
 *   it does not pretend to be one.  On a modulated dial the base is exactly what an arrow writes
 *   (rack.js `modHand`: on a routed parameter `write` IS `setBase`), so the arrow's own
 *   announcement and the frame loop's agree by construction and the mutation count stays at 0 —
 *   the base moves only when the user moves it.  `setBase(fn)` is the one wire: rack.js hands each
 *   of the eleven modulation targets its registry base, and a dial nobody drives never sees it.
 *   B140 gates the EAR, the EYE and the MODEL together, which is what B127 could not see.

     Three rulings a builder gets wrong, so they are written here rather than inferred:
       · SHIFT ON A STEPPED KNOB IS IGNORED.  `o.step` quantizes with Math.round(nv/step)*step, so a
         quarter-step lands off the lattice, rounds straight back to where it started, and Shift+Arrow
         becomes a DEAD KEY.  One arrow is one step, and Shift changes nothing.
       · `log` + `step` together (COUNT, n̄) step in VALUE space — denorm first, quantize second, which
         is exactly what the pointer does.  COUNT goes 160 → 170, which is what `step: 10` means.
       · A WRAP KNOB DOES NOT CLAMP, at the seam or anywhere.  From HUE = 0 one ArrowLeft lands at 0.99
         and the needle has gone the short way round; phase is an angle.  `v` is folded back into
         [lo, hi) by `settle()` — on BOTH roads since wave 68 — so `get()` and `aria-valuenow` stay
         inside [valuemin, valuemax].
       · AND WHAT `End` MEANS ON A WHEEL, ruled in wave 68 because the old answer made a declared
         attribute unreachable: Home, End and Delete were three names for the seam, so a dial that
         published `aria-valuemax="360"` could never announce it, which is a control telling an
         assistive technology something untrue.  **End is the declared maximum and it is NOT folded**
         — on a circle `hi` and `lo` are the same POINT and two different NUMBERS, so End paints the
         seam and says 360°, Home paints the seam and says 0°, and every arrow from either folds back
         into [lo, hi) as before.  The needle cannot tell them apart; the tree can, and now both ends
         of the declared range are reachable exactly once.
     Enter and Space are NOT owned: they stay the app's, so Space still plays the transport from a
     focused dial (rack.js, THE SINGLE-KEY LAW).  Nor is any modifier: Ctrl/⌘+Z undoes from in here. */
