/* shell/rack.js — the rack: the columns of windows at the screen's edges, the + and ☆ menus, drag to reorder, float
 * and dock, hide and peek, the transport's dodge, the phone's one rack, and the layout that survives a reload.
 *
 * Harvested from BASINS rack.js (the newest: the held card follows the hand while its neighbours swap, it stays in
 * the rack until it has cleared it by 12 px, a hidden rack is still a drop target, the phone crossing), checked
 * against λWAVES 0.3.2 (rack.js, rack-menus.js: the SHIFT-queue, favourite layouts, edge peek with an armed dismiss,
 * the transport dodge).  The DOM and the class names are theirs (`#rack`, `#rackL`, `#floats`, `.dev.floating`,
 * `.dragging`, `body.rack-hidden`, `rack-peek-left|right`, `#rackAdd`, `.mb-item`, `.mb-num`), so an adopting app's
 * own sheets keep matching and its look does not move.  docs/RACK.md is the manual.
 *
 * THE LAWS IT KEEPS
 *   1. A WINDOW IS REGISTERED BY NAME AND BUILT ON FIRST OPEN (EARTH's ask).  register() costs a Map entry; the
 *      device() shell and the window's own build(body, api) run the first time it opens.  EARTH's lifecycle law:
 *      FOLD keeps it running (onFold), CLOSE puts it to sleep (onClose / onSleep), POWER OFF frees it (onPower(false)).
 *      Whether its body can be seen at all is window-activity.js's answer, reported through onPresent(active).
 *   2. ONE GESTURE, ONE WRITER.  Every drag is core/pointer.js `drag` on one hidden grip, handed the press only once the
 *      hand has moved (so a click, a double click and every header button keep their own events).  The held window
 *      moves by `translate`; its neighbours FLIP (core/motion.js); the layout is committed once, on release.  Escape,
 *      pointercancel, a lost capture, a blur or a hidden page put everything back where the gesture began.
 *   3. THE DROP SHOWS WHERE IT LANDS (core/proximity.js): carrying a window over a rack draws the insertion slot it
 *      will land in, brightening with nearness and solid when release would land; while a docked window is carried,
 *      the slot it holds is drawn, and the rack's detach edge brightens as the window nears it.
 *   4. HIDE COSTS NOTHING, BY ONE PATH.  setHidden() writes `body.rack-hidden` and nothing else; window-activity.js
 *      reads that class and every window's presentation stands down.  A rack hides by TRANSFORM and DELAYED
 *      VISIBILITY only, never by fading it: an ancestor with opacity below one becomes what the glass inside it blurs
 *      (the likely cause of the Linux bug where a clicked rack window lost its blur).  rack.css says the same.
 *   5. A TOUCH USER ALWAYS HAS A WAY BACK: the edge handle shows while the interface is hidden on a coarse pointer.
 *   6. KEYBOARD AND TOUCH ARE FIRST-CLASS.  A window's header is focusable: ↑ ↓ move it in its rack, ← → move it to the
 *      other rack, Enter floats or docks it (arrows nudge a floating one).  A finger holds the header 400 ms to lift it.
 *   7. IDLE COSTS NOTHING: no poller, no rAF while nothing moves; peek reads one cached width per pointer move.
 *   8. THE LAYOUT IS DATA.  capture() → { v, hidden, phoneShown, cards: [{ id, side, open, folded, off, float }], nb? } in
 *      rack order, through an injected store; readLayout() repairs anything it is handed (unknown ids are dropped,
 *      never thrown on), and reads λWAVES' and BASINS' saved layouts (side 'L'/'R', `closed`) as they are.  A retired
 *      id resolves to its heir (`retired`), and a ☆ layout keeps the notebook's size (`nb`), as BASINS' did.
 *   9. BASINS' LEFTOVERS (1.5.0-alpha.12): the scrollbar seated at the card column (shell/rack-scrollbar.js,
 *      `scrollbar: true`), the touch-tablet float clamp (`tabletClamp`), RESET LAYOUT (`resetLayout()`), and COPY a
 *      window's readouts (`digest(id)`, `copyDigest(id)`, with BASINS' flash).
 *
 * createRack(options) → api — see docs/RACK.md.  windows() lists the windows with their titles and state (for describe()
 * and the openers); keepClear() gives the rects a new floating window should not land on (FOLDERS' first seat).  The pure helpers are exported for node tests. */

 * change — fold, open, close, content growing, a window dropped in or lifted out — is ONE refresh: the last layout's

 *   · a card whose height changed animates its HEIGHT from the old to the new (`.rack-sizing` clips it meanwhile) —
 *     the one sanctioned layout animation in the kit (docs/MOTION-LAW.md, "the rack's cards");
 *   · every card that moved travels by transform from where it was SEEN to its new place (FLIP);
 *   · the card in the hand is held (hold/follow/release): it follows the pointer by `translate`, is never FLIPped,
 *     and settles into its slot on release.
 * BASINS' numbers: 320 ms, cubic-bezier(.22, 1, .36, 1) — the kit's --motion-structural and --ease-out, the same
