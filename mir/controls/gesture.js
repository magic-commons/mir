/* controls/gesture.js — what the colour controls share: the fine gear, the double-tap home and the forwarded press.
 *
 * THE LAW IT KEEPS: ONE HAND LAW PER KIT.  The kit's knob law lives in kit.js (`setKnobLaw`: travel, touch travel and
 * the fine divisor); this file READS it, never owns a copy of its numbers, so Josh's "Shift is an eighth" is one
 * number that the arc knob, the hue swatch and the lane slider all follow.  What is here is what BASINS'
 * colour-controls.js added around that law and the kit had not got:
 *   · the FINE GEAR is engaged by ANY modifier (Shift, Alt, Ctrl, Meta) or by a SECOND FINGER down while one drags
 *     (BASINS window.js fineTouchHeld); engaging it moves nothing (the controls keep a virtual point);
 *   · the DOUBLE-TAP is two presses within 300 ms and 14 px, taken on the press itself;
 *   · a press a control stops is FORWARDED, so the menus, the rack's + list and the float layer's raise still hear
 *     "a press happened outside you".
 * (Harvested from BASINS app/colour-controls.js wireTouches, fineHeld, forward.)  `fineHeld` and `fineGain` are re-exports
 * of kit.js's one law (watchTouches, fineHeld, gearOf). */
